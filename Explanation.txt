We are going to add sound and animation to the game.
What is our GOAL for today`s video : 

We used our knowledge of functions, loops, and operators to create different behaviors in
different conditions.

What did we ACHIEVE in the class TODAY?
● Stored the state of a game in a variable.
● Displayed different information on the screen according to the state of the game.
● Used conditional programming and logical operators to assign different behaviors to
the objects in the game depending on the state of the game.

Which CONCEPTS/ CODING BLOCKS did we cover today?
● Game state
● Logical operators
● Conditional programming

How did we DO the activities?

In a game, there is a change of state, for example, Start, Play, and End.

1. The first state (Serve state) is when the ball is at the center and the user needs to
press "Space" to serve the ball.

2. The second state (Play state) is when the play starts, and the ball is in motion.

Specific instruction: If the user presses space and the game is in SERVE state, then
serve the ball.

3. Change the GameState variable back to "serve" state inside the condition ‘when the
ball crosses the screen’.

4. Add a scoring system and the condition to increase the player or computer score
when the opposite paddle misses hitting the ball.

5. The third state (Game over) is when the player or computer scores 5 points.

6. The game then ends and the player needs to press "R" to restart the game.
